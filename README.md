## Overview

Allow non-operator creative players to configure NPCs. This release is aligned with Endstone 0.11.9 and Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server 1.26.44, and is distributed as a Python wheel for direct installation in an Endstone server.

## What it does

- Allows selected non-operator creative players to configure Bedrock NPCs.
- Uses a narrow permission instead of granting full operator privileges.
- Provides explicit grant, revoke, and list operations for delegated NPC editors.

## How to use

1. As an operator, run `/npc grant <player>` for each trusted creative-mode NPC editor.
2. Have the player enter creative mode and interact with an NPC to verify editor access.
3. Review delegated users with `/npc list` and remove access with `/npc revoke <player>`.

## Commands and permissions

| Command / usage | What it does | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `/npc grant <player: str>`<br>`/npc revoke <player: str>`<br>`/npc list` | NPC Permissions management | `npcperm.admin` |

## Compatibility

| Component | Supported version |
|---|---|
| Endstone | `0.11.9` |
| Endstone API | `0.11` |
| Bedrock Dedicated Server | `1.26.44` |
| Python | `>=3.10` |
| Plugin release | `v1.0.2` |

## Install

Download the wheel from the matching GitHub release:

```bash
gh release download v1.0.2 --repo TheNINJALLO/endstone-npc-permissions --pattern "*.whl"
```

Copy the downloaded wheel into the server's `plugins/` directory, remove any older wheel for the same plugin, and restart Endstone.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use Endstone `0.11.9` with BDS `1.26.44`. Back up worlds and plugin data before upgrading a production server.

## Configuration and secrets

Runtime databases, logs, local `.env` files, server directories, and root `config.toml` files are excluded from source releases. When an example configuration is provided, copy it locally and keep live tokens, passwords, webhook URLs, and server identifiers out of Git.

## Release automation

Every `v*` tag runs [the wheel release workflow](.github/workflows/wheel-release.yml), builds the package in a clean GitHub runner, stores the wheel as a workflow artifact, and attaches it to the matching GitHub release.
